# Corpus
#### A collection of CSS things

Corpus is yet another CSS toolkit. It’s basically a collection of the things I find [myself](http://jamiewilson.io) returning to for each new project. It uses [Flexbox](http://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/flexbox/) for the grid system, [viewport-based heights and percentage-based widths](http://bitsofco.de/2015/viewport-vs-percentage-units/), is heavily influenced by Basscss’s [White Space](http://www.basscss.com/docs/white-space/) module, and has a few useful greyscale color utilities. For syntax highlighting I'm using [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com/) and my own [Predawn](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Predawn) color scheme, with code set in [Office Code Pro](https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro). Styles are written in SCSS.

### Docs

The docs currently live here: https://github.com/jamiewilson/corpus-site, and is kept in a separate repo (rather than a branch) in order to make it possible to symlink the .scss files into other projects. This makes it easier to make revisions back into the Corpus source files within the context of the docs site. 

### Alpha
Please note that Corpus is in an Alpha stage right now and hasn't been tested much. Feel free to leave feedback and requests on the Issues page.
