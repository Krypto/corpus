### Corpus is a small CSS toolkit. Learn more at http://corpuscss.com.

The source files currently can be found here: https://github.com/jamiewilson/corpus, and is kept in a separate repo (rather than a branch) in order to make it possible to symlink the .scss files into other projects. This makes it easier to make revisions back into the Corpus source files within the context of the docs site and also requires less `git pull`ing to keep separate projects up to date.
